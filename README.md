# ABOUT IISD-ELA _Chlorobia_ _cyc2_ genomics project
Copyright Jackson M. Tsuji, Neufeld Research Group, 2019

This Github repository describes the steps/code used to perform bioinformatics analysis for the paper by Tsuji and colleagues, 2019 (pre-print link will be posted here once available). Descriptor files in this repo are in the Markdown (`.md`) format and begin with `README`. Other files include scripts and raw data files. The information is organized as follows:

## `Data_analysis_pipeline`
Describes the protocol used to produce assembled contigs and genome bins from the raw metagenomic datasets used for this paper.

**Includes** `01_data_acquisition` for how to download the online sequencing data associated with this paper, including raw read data and genome bins.

## Tables and figures
A unique folder exists for most main or supplementary tables/figures in the publication, e.g., `Figure_01_cyc2_genes`. These describe the steps required to analyze the data for the figure and to generate a raw version of the figure for downstream editing.

## `Other`
Some supplementary material did not warrant having its own folder, so it is grouped in the `Other` folder exactly as it would appear in the Supplementary Information on the journal website.

## Zenodo
Note that this repo has a corresponding data repository in Zenodo for hosting larger files (e.g., non-curated genome bins). Check out the Zenodo version (`v1.0.1`) corresponding to the current Gitub repo code below:  
[![Zenodo data repository](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3228469.svg)](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3228469)

Code in this repo shows how to use the files in the Zenodo repo for analysis.

## Final remarks
I hope this is a helpful resource for the scientific community, both in the critique of my work and in further development of bioinformatics. Feel free to post an issue if you have any questions or concerns. Enjoy!
