## 1. Data collection
The `input_files` directory contains the data used to create the plot:
- `ELA111314_dRep_gtdbtk.bac120.summary.tsv` and `ELA111314_dRep_gtdbtk.ar122.summary.tsv` - taxonomy assignments output from the GTDBTk classifier for the bacterial and archaeal genome bins, respectively. Generated in `Data_analysis_pipeline/05_bin_analysis/02_gtdbtk_taxonomy`.
- `read_mapping_stats.tsv` - output file from read mapping of unassembled metagenomic reads against genome bins, generated in `Data_analysis_pipeline/05_bin_analysis/04_read_mapping`
- `assembled_read_stats.tsv` - summary of the total assembled reads (estimated by read mapping) from each metagenome, generated in `Data_analysis_pipeline/05_bin_analysis/04_read_mapping`
- `checkm_stats_reduced.tsv` - slightly modified output file from checkM generated at `Data_analysis_pipeline/03_bin_curation/04_bin_stats`. Columns of `completeness.tsv` are renamed to be a bit more human-readable, and `taxonomy.tsv` info is added.
- `metannotate_annotations_genome_bins.tsv` - the MetAnnotate annotations for the genome bins, generated in `Data_analysis_pipeline/05_bin_analysis/03_metannotate/output_genome_bins`
- `hmm_info.tsv` - guide file specifying which HMM hits are to be plotted and the plotting names of the HMMs
- `dataset_info_metannotate.tsv` - guide file specifying which genome bins from MetAnnotate are to be plotted and their plotting names
- `dataset_info_read_mapping.tsv` - guide file specifying which metagenomes from read mapping are to be plotted and their plotting names

## 2. Plotting the figure
Ran `plot/Figure_03_plotter.R` in interactive mode (e.g., in RStudio) to produce `plot/Figure_03_raw.pdf`. Note that you'll need to install all libraries loaded at the top of the script. The script also outputs `plot/plotting_name_arrangement_raw.tsv` as a full summary of the taxonomy of each entry in the final plot. After running the script, I then cleaned up the raw figure in Inkscape to make `plot/Figure_03_cleaned.pdf`, the final figure. Minimal post-production editing was needed -- e.g., cleaning up labels, added phylum labels for added visual info (panel B), and adding panel labels. 

This results in the following figure:
![Figure_03](plot/Figure_03_cleaned.png)

See R package versions in `R_session_info.log`. Log was generated after running the above script by:
```R
sink("R_session_info.log")
sessionInfo()
sink()
```
