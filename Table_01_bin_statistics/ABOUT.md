# ABOUT Table 1 - genome bin statistics
Copyright Jackson M. Tsuji, Neufeld Research Group, 2019
Part of the larger *IISD-ELA Chlorobia cyc2 project*.

Not much needs to be said here. The table was assembled manually from seprate data files:
- Completeness and contamination: from CheckM

- # of tRNAs: from counting the tRNA labels in the prokka output TSV table


**Maybe just delete this file and only focus on things that took code to generate, like the figures**
