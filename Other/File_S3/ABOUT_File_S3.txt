# ABOUT Supplementary File 3

This ZIP folder contains two files:

1. cyc2_Fig1_unmasked.faa -- amino acid sequence alignment of the cyc2 genes recovered from Chlorobia in this study, the cyc2 genes from the four reference Chlorobia, and the cyc2 genes summarized from reference genomes by He and colleagues, 2017 (see reference in main text)

2. cyc2_Fig1_masked.faa -- the same as 'cyc2_Fig1_unmasked.faa', except run through Gblock to mask (delete) ambiguous regions of the sequence alignment (see Methods). This was used to build the cyc2 phylogenetic tree (see Methods).

3. c5_family_Chlorobia_aligned.faa -- amino acid sequence alignment of the cytochrome c5 family genes recovered from Chlorobia in this study, the cytochrome c5 family genes from the four reference Chlorobia

3. cyc2_Fig3_other_hits_L227_L442.faa -- amino acid sequence alignment of the cyc2 genes recovered from non-Chlorobia genome bins from the metagenome datasets, as presented in Fig. 3B
